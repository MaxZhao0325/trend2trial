You are writing the PRD for an open-source project called "trend2trial" (Trend Radar + Trial Playground).
Output files:

- docs/PRD.md
- docs/MVP.md
- docs/ROADMAP.md

Requirements:

1. PRD must include: problem, target users (software engineers), non-goals, user stories, success metrics.
2. MVP must be buildable in 2-3 weeks and focus on AI Infra (Serving/RAG/LLMOps).
3. ROADMAP must show v0 (MVP), v1 (more sources/recipes), v2 (expand beyond infra).
   Use concise bullets and concrete acceptance criteria.
